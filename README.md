# bugfarm

you should continue developing this with pictures and other resources until eventually it can be turned into a Bug Zine and maybe a Bug Class.

## mealworm farm
* stored in a converted worm bin with progressively finer mesh hot-glued into each lower bin, allowing self-sorting of frass
* get excess grains for mealworms from either honest weight or sav-a-lot

## worm bin
* red wiggler worms in a multi-stage plastic bin
* can compost lots of things

## snail farm
* can compost some food scraps
* escargot

## pillbug farm
* Basically raise them like snails.  They can eat a wide variety of food scraps
* Buy them [here](http://shop.bugsincyberspace.com/Sow-Bugs-Gray-Porcellio-15-ct-bic700.htm)
* [article](https://www.naturalnews.com/049190_rollie_pollies_heavy_metals_soil_remediation.html) about their role in bioremediation and composting

## carpet beetle farm
* carpet beetle larvae [eat clothing](http://greatgrayowlpc.com.websitematic.ca/files/resized/18917/cropped/870;489;894c4e9b73155745bb4b69b143568dc812feee79.jpg). This could potentially be used for clothing composting.
* the carpet beetles present a potential infestation risk for the home. So they should be kept in a secure container.  Consider putting a ring of [cedar or neem oil](https://www.homeremedyhacks.com/11-easy-ways-get-rid-of-carpet-beetles/) on the lid.
* [Boil the refuse](https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Carpet-Beetles) to kill eggs and larvae before composting it.


## ecosystem terrarium
* build a terrarium in which different species of bug live together!
* you'd have red worms, mealworms, and possibly snails too
* you'd also grow plants there. perhaps low-light plants
* would the plants help solve the excess moisture problem?
* would you need different stages? perhaps a gravel layer to keep some bugs dry?

## other
* [jewelry organizer](https://www.amazon.com/Organizer-Container-Removable-Dividers-Transparent/dp/B01NBLOXEC/ref=pd_sim_201_3?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01NBLOXEC&pd_rd_r=CZQJ6PCX6A5F0XHRT9B1&pd_rd_w=aFzRF&pd_rd_wg=NtFqY&psc=1&refRID=CZQJ6PCX6A5F0XHRT9B1) - could be a great way to transport bugs to meetings
