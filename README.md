# bugfarm

## mealworm farm
* stored in a converted worm bin with progressively finer mesh hot-glued into each lower bin, allowing self-sorting of frass
* get excess grains for mealworms from either honest weight or sav-a-lot

## worm bin
* red wiggler worms in a multi-stage plastic bin
* can compost lots of things

## snail farm
* can compost some food scraps
* escargot

## ecosystem terrarium
* build a terrarium in which different species of bug live together!
* you'd have red worms, mealworms, and possibly snails too
* you'd also grow plants there. perhaps low-light plants
* would the plants help solve the excess moisture problem?
* would you need different stages? perhaps a gravel layer to keep some bugs dry?
